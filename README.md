# Ace

## Description

Ace authentication is a service that provides basic email, username, and password based authentication for side projects.

I usually find that whenever I make a side project that requires authentication I start with a simple basic authentication system which I later improve or add upon as the side project evolves.

Ace authenication will now just be a service which I can use to authenicate my side projects without having to manually make the same authenication system for my side projects.
